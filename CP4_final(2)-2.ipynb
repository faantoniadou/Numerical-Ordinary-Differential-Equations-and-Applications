This is a template Jupyter notebook that introduces the ODE system and sets the four tasks that make up the assignment. In order to complete the assignment, you must perform the four tasks by adding Python code to this notebook.\n",
    "The figures that you produce should have labeled axes, a title, and where appropriate, a legend to distinguish between plots.\n",
    "To submit your completed work (a) create a pdf version of the notebook when all cells have been run (on a Mac/Safari system this may be done via \"File\", \"Print Preview\" and \"Export as PDF\"), (b) submit both the .ipynb and .pdf versions\" electronically on Learn. Hence, you are asked to submit two files: a Jupyter notebook and the corresponding pdf version. If there is any inconsistency between the two files, we will regard the .ipynb version as your definitive submission. Make sure that your name is clearly indicated at the top of the notebook.\n",
